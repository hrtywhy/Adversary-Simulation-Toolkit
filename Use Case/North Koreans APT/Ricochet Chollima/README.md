# Ricochet Chollima APT Adversary Simulation

This is a simulation of an attack by the (Ricochet Chollima) APT group, targeting several activists focused on North Korea. The attack campaign began in March 2025. The attack chain started with spear-phishing. The email contained a Dropbox link leading to a compressed archive that included a malicious shortcut (LNK) file. When extracted and executed, the LNK file activated additional malware containing the keyword "toy." The content was disguised as an academic forum invitation from a South Korean national security think tank to attract attention.

This simulation is based on research from Genians: https://www.genians.co.kr/en/blog/threat_intelligence/toybox-story

Based on the characteristics of the threat, Genians Security Center (GSC) named the campaign “Operation: ToyBox Story”

The attacker impersonated a North Korea-focused expert based in South Korea, and the email used the subject line “러시아 전장에 투입된 인민군 장병들에게.hwp” (To North Korean People’s Army Soldiers Deployed to the Russian Battlefield.hwp) with the attachment carrying the same file name, the attachment mimicked a Hangul (HWP) document by displaying the HWP icon image used by Naver Mail, and the attacker leveraged this icon to make the attachment appear as a legitimate file link, however the actual download link redirected to Dropbox, which led to a ZIP archive named “러시아 전장에 투입된 인민군 장병들에게.zip” (To North Korean People’s Army Soldiers Deployed to the Russian Battlefield.zip).



1. Delivery Technique: Create document file  masquerading as information on North Korean troops deployed to Russia.



2. Malicious shortcut: make single shortcut (LNK) file. This LNK file executes malicious code and shares the same name as the ZIP     archive, with only the file extension being different.


3. PowerShell Commands: The shortcut (LNK) file is configured to run via PowerShell commands embedded arguments.


4. Toy.Bat: When the PowerShell command in “toy03.bat” file is executed, it loads “toy02.dat” file created in temporary folder,       functioning as a loader.


5. Dropbox C2: Get Command and Control through payload uses the Dropbox API to upload data including command output to Dropbox.


6.  TCP payload: This payload that establishes a TCP connection to a remote server for command execution.

## The first stage (delivery technique)

The attacker impersonated a North Korea-focused expert based in South Korea. The spear-phishing email employed the subject line “러시아 전장에 투입된 인민군 장병들에게.hwp” (To North Korean Soldiers Deployed to the Russian Battlefield.hwp), with an attachment carrying the identical file name. The attachment was crafted to mimic a Hangul (HWP) document by leveraging the HWP icon image commonly associated with Naver Mail, thereby increasing its credibility. The threat actor intentionally used this icon to make the file appear as a legitimate document; however, the embedded link redirected the victim to a Dropbox-hosted payload instead of delivering a benign file. The Dropbox URL ultimately provided a compressed archive containing additional malicious components.

## The second stage (Malicious shortcut)

The archive named “관련 포스터.zip” (Related Poster.zip) contained a benign JPG image alongside a malicious LNK shortcut. Upon execution of the LNK file, a hidden PowerShell command embedded within the shortcut was triggered, initiating the malicious activity. 

<img width="1022" height="342" alt="Screenshot From 2025-08-25 17-44-29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6c2d433-a7ac-4a88-b791-7ed684717224" />


Now I need to create a JPG image that looks like a normal picture, but in the background when the image is opened the PowerShell command starts running silently. At this stage I used WinRAR to bind the JPG with a command line execution via CMD so that when the image is opened it triggers the hidden activity, and I also used an icon format to make the file appear legitimate.

After using WinRAR to compress the file, I will create a shortcut to this file and place it in another folder together with the actual images, then convert the folder into a ZIP file using standard ZIP compression.

## The third stage (execution technique)

Because I put the command line in the setup (Run after extraction) menu in the Advanced SFX options of the WinRAR program, now when the victim opens the ZIP file to view the images, they also see an HWP document containing a letter addressed to North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia.

## The fourth stage (Toy.bat - shellcode)

When the PowerShell command in “toy03.bat” executes, it loads the “toy02.dat” file created in the temporary folder to function as a loader; the embedded PowerShell within “toy02.dat” then runs and loads “toy01.dat” from the same folder, during which XOR transformed data is decoded and mapped into memory and a new thread is spawned; as a result, the shellcode is placed in memory and the region is made executable.

<img width="1021" height="484" alt="Screenshot From 2025-10-09 12-00-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf95c8c-b85d-4d40-bc8d-43d2cb796e14" />

After which another thread is created to run the memory-resident code constituting a fileless technique for dynamic code execution and runtime malware injection.

As a result, the shellcode is loaded into memory and the memory area becomes executable.

I used shellcode to execute calc.exe for testing but later after compiling the base payload I will use the host-file program included in BearC2 to upload the payload and obtain a masked URL. As shown in the server header for Dropbox in the figure, opening that link causes the payload to download automatically without any interaction from the victim. I will then use the (start) command, insert the URL that carries the payload convert it to shellcode and place it in the shellcode slot instead of the calc.exe shellcode.

## The fifth stage (Data Exfiltration) over Dropbox API C2 Channe

The attackers used the Dropbox C2 (Command and Control) API as a means to establish a communication channel between their payload and the attacker's server. By using Dropbox as a C2 server, attackers can hide their malicious activities among the legitimate traffic to Dropbox, making it harder for security teams to detect the threat.

First, I need to create a Dropbox account and activate its permissions, as shown in the following figure.

After that, I will go to the settings menu to generate the access token for the Dropbox account, and this is what we will use in Dropbox C2.

## The sixth stage (payload with injected Shellcode)

This payload that establishes a TCP connection to a remote server for command execution. It uses AES encryption in CBC mode to secure communication, with a 128-bit key for encrypting and decrypting data. The client authenticates with a predefined ID and executes commands received from the server, supporting both CMD and PowerShell commands. Output from executed commands is encrypted and sent back to the server. The program includes a Dropbox API function for file upload and employs Base64 encoding for data handling.

This payload uses the Dropbox API to upload data, including command output to Dropbox. By leveraging the Dropbox API and providing an access token the payload hides its traffic within the legitimate traffic of the Dropbox.

Now I will upload the file to BearC2's host-file, use the start command with the URL, convert it to shellcode, and place it in the main payload.

## Final result: payload connect to BEAR-C2 server

The final step in this process involves the execution of the final payload. After being decrypted and loaded into the current process, the final payload is designed to beacon out to both Dropbox API-based C2 server.
